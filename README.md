# Stock-Market-Prediction-Analysis
A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction using LSTM stack.
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.
Here I used Tiingo to get my dataset.
Tiingo is basically a stock market tool which awesome if you are interested to know more about Tiingo here you can directly check 
The agenda of the project is to collect the data of APPLE's stock prices of last few years upto today and analysis the data and do prediction for the future stock prices.
The steps I followed to fullfill that goal:
1.Data collection of the stocks -- AAPL
2.Preprocess the dataset into training and testing
3.Create a stacked LSTM model
4.Predict the test data and plot the output
